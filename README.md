I Used unity DOTS and entities in the whole project aswell as burstcompiled everything that was possible to in order to increase perfromance.

Sadly I couldn't get the collision with the bullets and enemies to work.
Build crashes on startup sadly I can't get it to work hopefully the failed build will be enough
