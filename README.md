I Used unity DOTS and entities in the whole project aswell as burstcompiled everything that was possible to in order to increase perfromance.

Sadly I couldn't get the collision with the bullets and enemies to work.
Also build crashes on startup and only half of the time the build succeds, I've got no errors in editor and am really confused
