I Used unity DOTS and entities and also in the whole project and some jobs in the project also burstcompiling everything that was possible to in order to increase perfromance.

Sadly I couldn't get the collision with the bullets and enemies to work.
Build crashes on startup sadly I can't get it to work hopefully the failed build will be enough.
